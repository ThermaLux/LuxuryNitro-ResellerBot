# LuxuryNitro Reseller
A Discord Bot used to resell credits from luxurynitro.com, using it's API.

## Setup
1. Download and install Python 3.9 or a more recent version.
2. Download this repo and install dependancies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Setup your config in config.yml
4. Run using `python main.py`

## Languages
If you would like to use a different language for the bot, replace your lang.yml file with your languages file, found in the "langs" folder.

If your language isn't in there, then you will have to translate yourself. We are adding more translations as soon as we can.
